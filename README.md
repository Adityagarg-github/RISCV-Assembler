## RISCV-Assembler
- The RISC-V Assembler is a versatile tool designed for both learning and experimentation with the RISC-V instruction set architecture (RV32I). It provides a platform where users can write and execute RISC-V assembly code. Equipped with features such as loading code from files, step-by-step execution, it offers a comprehensive environment for program analysis. The assembler showcases register and memory contents during execution, enhancing comprehension.

## Valid Instructions
- R format: add, and, or, sll, slt, sra, srl, sub, xor, mul, div, rem  
- I format: addi, andi, ori, lb, ld, lh, lw, jalr  
- S format: sb, sw, sd, sh  
- SB format: beq, bne, bge, blt  
- U format: auipc, lui  
- UJ format: jal  
- Assembler Directives: .text, .data, .byte, .half, .word, .dword, .asciiz
